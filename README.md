# TypeFlow | The Ultimate Flow State Experience

![TypeFlow Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1000x500?text=TypeFlow+Preview) 
## 🚀 Overview

**TypeFlow** is a high-performance, immersive typing application designed to help users achieve a "flow state." Unlike traditional typing tests, TypeFlow emphasizes precision and rhythm. 

It features a **"Hard Mode"** engine where the **Backspace key is disabled**, forcing users to focus on accuracy and forward momentum rather than correction. Built with a modern neon-cyberpunk aesthetic, it provides instant visual feedback and zero-latency interaction.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔒 Hard Mode (Strict Typing):** The Backspace key is intentionally disabled. Users cannot correct mistakes, mimicking the experience of a typewriter and enforcing absolute focus.
- **⚡ Zero Latency Architecture:** Optimized React state management ensures the cursor moves instantly with every keystroke, providing a "buttery smooth" feel.
- **🎨 Dynamic Visuals:** - **Neon/Cyberpunk Theme:** Glowing text effects and animated aurora backgrounds.
  - **Glassmorphism:** Modern UI elements with frosted glass effects.
  - **Interactive Feedback:** Correct letters glow; incorrect inputs trigger visual shake effects or error highlighting.
- **📊 Real-Time Metrics:**
  - Live **WPM** (Words Per Minute) calculation.
  - Dynamic **Accuracy** tracking.
- **📱 Fully Responsive:** Works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and modern mobile browsers.
